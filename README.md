# miscellaneous-testcases

Test cases derived from various support requests and bugs, suitable for future regression testing

## Repository structure

The *support* directory contains resources (images, SVG files etc) that can be re-used by several test cases. See the README file inside that folder for a description of the files.

Inside directories like *layout* and *scripting* are tests related to that category. *All* files inside such directories are considered individual tests. Supporting files like images, frame contents or XHR data must be placed in the *support* directory.
